   - Usage instructions

### Package.json Scripts

Added the following npm scripts for easy test execution:

```json
"test": "tsx tests/run-all-tests.ts",
"test:auth": "tsx tests/auth-flow.test.ts",
"test:accounts": "tsx tests/accounts-crud.test.ts",
"test:transactions": "tsx tests/transactions-crud.test.ts",
"test:credit-cards": "tsx tests/credit-cards-crud.test.ts"
```

## Test Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Real Data Testing**: Tests use actual API endpoints and database operations (no mocks)
2. **Isolation**: Each test suite creates its own test user and data
3. **Cleanup**: Tests delete created resources after validation
4. **Idempotency**: Tests can be run multiple times without conflicts
5. **Clear Output**: Detailed logging with pass/fail indicators and data inspection

### Test Structure

Each test file follows a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Test configuration
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

// 2. Test data and state
let authToken: string | null = null;
let createdResourceId: string | null = null;

// 3. Helper functions
function logResult(result: TestResult) { ... }

// 4. Setup function (if needed)
async function setupAuth() { ... }

// 5. Individual test functions
async function testCreateResource() { ... }
async function testUpdateResource() { ... }
async function testDeleteResource() { ... }

// 6. Test runner
async function runAllTests() { ... }

// 7. Execution
runAllTests().catch(error => { ... });
```

## Test Coverage

### Total Test Count: 27 tests

- **Authentication**: 7 tests
- **Accounts**: 6 tests
- **Transactions**: 8 tests
- **Credit Cards**: 6 tests

### Coverage by Requirement

- **Requirement 3.1, 3.2, 3.3** (API Routes and Services): 20 tests
- **Requirement 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5** (Authentication): 7 tests

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Start development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Ensure Appwrite is configured in `.env.local`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run individual test suites
pnpm test:auth
pnpm test:accounts
pnpm test:transactions
pnpm test:credit-cards
```

### Expected Results

All tests should pass when:

- Development server is running
- Appwrite is properly configured
- Database migrations have been applied
- No conflicting data exists

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are designed for CI/CD integration:

- Exit code 0 on success
- Exit code 1 on failure
- Detailed output for debugging
- Sequential execution to avoid race conditions

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: |
    pnpm dev &
    sleep 5
    pnpm test
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Test Framework**: Uses manual test scripts instead of Jest/Vitest
2. **Sequential Execution**: Tests run one at a time (not parallel)
3. **Manual Cleanup**: Relies on test logic for cleanup (no automatic teardown)
4. **No Mocking**: All tests hit real APIs and database

### Future Improvements

1. Integrate with a proper testing framework (Jest/Vitest)
2. Add unit tests for individual functions
3. Add integration tests with mocked Appwrite
4. Implement parallel test execution
5. Add performance benchmarking
6. Add visual regression testing for UI components
7. Add E2E tests with Playwright

## Verification

All test files have been verified:

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Consistent code structure
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Proper exit codes

## Conclusion

Task 31 "Testes e validação" has been successfully completed with all sub-tasks implemented. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of authentication, accounts, transactions, and credit cards functionality, with clear documentation and easy-to-use scripts for both development and CI/CD environments.
