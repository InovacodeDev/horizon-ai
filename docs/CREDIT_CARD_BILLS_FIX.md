# Credit Card Bills Table Fix

## Problem

The `/api/credit-cards/bills` endpoint was returning a 500 error with:

```
AppwriteException: Table with the requested ID could not be found.
```

## Root Cause

The `credit_card_bills` table was missing from the Appwrite database, even though migration `20251027_000014` showed as applied. The migration created 3 tables:

- `credit_card_bills` ❌ (was missing)
- `installment_plans` ❌ (was missing)
- `credit_card_transactions` ✅ (existed)

## Solution

The table was manually recreated using the script `scripts/recreate-bills-table.ts`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created the credit_card_bills table

- Table ID: `credit_card_bills`
- Columns:
  - `credit_card_id` (string, 255, required)
  - `user_id` (string, 255, required)
  - `due_date` (datetime, required)
  - `closing_date` (datetime, required)
  - `total_amount` (float, required)
  - `paid_amount` (float, required)
  - `status` (enum: open, closed, paid, overdue, required)
  - `created_at` (datetime, required)
  - `updated_at` (datetime, required)

### 2. Created indexes

- `idx_credit_card_id` on `credit_card_id`
- `idx_user_id` on `user_id`

### 3. Verified table exists

The table now appears in the database and can be queried.

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - The `credit_card_bills` table now exists and the API endpoint should work.

## Next Steps

1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Test the endpoint: `GET /api/credit-cards/bills?status=open`
3. The endpoint should now return a 200 response with an empty bills array (or populated if you have data)

## Note About installment_plans Table

The `installment_plans` table is also missing from the same migration. If you need this table, you can create it similarly or re-run the migration for that specific table.

## Scripts Created

- `scripts/list-databases.ts` - List all databases in the project
- `scripts/list-tables.ts` - List all tables in a database
- `scripts/recreate-bills-table.ts` - Recreate the credit_card_bills table
- `scripts/verify-credit-card-bills-table.ts` - Verify the table exists
- `scripts/test-adapter-directly.ts` - Test the Appwrite adapter
- `scripts/debug-client.ts` - Debug client initialization
- `scripts/test-bills-api.ts` - Test the bills API logic
- `scripts/final-verification.ts` - Comprehensive verification test

These scripts can be useful for debugging similar issues in the future.
