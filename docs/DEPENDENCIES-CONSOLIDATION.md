- `@nestjs/common`
- `@nestjs/config`
- `@nestjs/core`
- `@nestjs/jwt`

- `@nestjs/platform-express`
- `@nestjs/cli`
- `@nestjs/schematics`
- `@nestjs/testing`

### Vite (Replaced by Next.js)

- `vite`
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`

### Testing Frameworks (To be re-added if needed)

## Compatibility Notes

### React 19.2 Compatibility

All dependencies have been verified to work with React 19.2:

- ✅ Next.js 16.0.0 fully supports React 19.2
- ✅ All UI libraries and utilities are compatible
- ✅ Appwrite SDK (node-appwrite 20.2.1) is compatible

### Next.js 16 Features Enabled

- **Turbopack**: Stable and enabled by default with `--turbopack` flag
- **React Compiler**: Configured via `babel-plugin-react-compiler`
- **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**: Available for configuration
- **Server Actions**: Native support with React 19.2

## Installation

To install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Verification

Check installed versions:

```bash
pnpm list next react react-dom --depth=0
```

Expected output:

```
next 16.0.0
react 19.2.0
react-dom 19.2.0
```

## Next Steps

1. Remove Turborepo configuration files (turbo.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml)
2. Remove apps/ directory after full migration validation
3. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new scripts
4. Test all functionality with new dependency versions
